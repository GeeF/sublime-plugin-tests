## Proof of Concept
1. Write sublime command to open scratch file (tbd whether it exists/not) with input and cursors at selected point
2. Perform action as configured (e.g. `left_delete`)
3. Assert content + cursor position matches output

## Polish
4. Repeat on remaining files
5. Collect feedback and return results
